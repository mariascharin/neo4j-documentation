The built-in `admin` role is a special role which includes ability to perform a number of administrative tasks.
Users who are granted the `admin` role obtain the privileges to perform the following classes of tasks:

* Manage database security for controlling the privileges to perform actions on specific databases (see <<administration-managing-database-privileges>> for a thorough description on managing database privileges):
** Manage access to a database and the right to start and stop a database
** Manage indexes and constraints
** Allow the creation of new labels, relationship types or property names
* Manage DBMS security for controlling the privileges to perform actions on the entire system (see <<administration-managing-dbms-privileges>> for a thorough description on managing DBMS privileges):
** Manage multiple databases
** Manage users and roles
** Change configuration parameters
** Manage transactions
** Manage sub-graph privileges
** Manage procedure security

These privileges are a combination of abilities that can be managed using `GRANT`, `DENY` and `REVOKE` commands, with the exception of the _DBMS Security_ privileges which are only available within the built-in `admin` role.
