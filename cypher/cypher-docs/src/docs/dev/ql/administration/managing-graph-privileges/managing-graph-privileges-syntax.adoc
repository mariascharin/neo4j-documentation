{ GRANT \| DENY } graph-privilege
ON GRAPH[S] { graph-name \| * }
[ entity ] 
TO role [, ...]
.2+.^| Exactly one graph privilege can be granted in each statement.

Privileges can either be granted to one specific named graph, or all graphs signified with `*`.

Specifying `entity` is optional.
| [source, cypher]
REVOKE [ GRANT \| DENY ] graph-privilege
ON GRAPH[S] { graph-name \| * }
[ entity ] 
FROM role [, ...]

// Note to self:
// Only one graph privilege per statement
// Either only one graph or *
// entity is entirely optional

| Possible values | Description
| [source, cypher]
TRAVERSE
| Allows the specified nodes and/or relationships to be found.
| [source, cypher]
READ {
property_name [, ...] \| * }
| Grants `READ` privilege to the specified properties.

Granting property `READ` access does not imply that the entity (node and/or relationship) with that property can be found.

For example if there is also a `DENY` on the entity, it will not be found.
| [source, cypher]
MATCH {
property_name [, ...] \| * }
| Combines both `TRAVERSE` and `READ`, allowing an entity to be found and its properties read.

`REVOKE MATCH` is not supported.

Instead you must perform `REVOKE` on the individual `READ` and `TRAVERSE` privileges.
| [source, cypher]
WRITE {*}
| Grants the `WRITE` privilege.

The `WRITE` privilege can only be assigned to all nodes, relationships and properties in the entire graph.

This means that, if specified, the `entity` part of the command must be `ELEMENTS *` and cannot be more specific.
