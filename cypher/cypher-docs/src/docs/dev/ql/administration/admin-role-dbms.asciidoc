As mentioned in <<administration-managing-roles-the-admin-role>>, the `admin` role has a number of built-in privileges that cannot be assigned using Cypher commands.
These include:

* Create or drop databases
* Change configuration parameters
* Manage transactions
* Manage users and roles (role management by itself is assignable using <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-role-management, Cypher commands>>)
* Manage sub-graph privileges
* Manage procedure security

The easiest way to enable a user to perform these tasks is to grant them the `admin` role.
The only subset of these privileges that is assignable using Cypher commands is <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-role-management, role management>>.
However, it is possible to make a custom role with a subset of these privileges.
